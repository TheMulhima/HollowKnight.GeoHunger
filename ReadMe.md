# GeoHunger

GeoHunger is a Hollow Knight mod that slowly depletes the player's Geo over time, and when it reaches 0 will "starve" the player, slowly draining the Knight of masks.

Geo depletion/starvation do not apply when:
- Talking with NPCs
- Resting at/near a bench
- Recoiling from other damage
- Unable to control the Knight otherwise
- In God Seeker mode

In addition to the above, starvation also doesn't apply when invulnerable.

You can adjust the difficulty under Settings -> Mods in-game.

There is also a "Geo ramp" feature which linearly increases the Geo depletion rate with your current Geo.
