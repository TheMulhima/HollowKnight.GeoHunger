# GeoHunger

GeoHunger is a Hollow Knight mod that slowly depletes the player's Geo over time, and when it reaches 0 will "starve" the player, slowly draining the Knight of masks.

The player depletion do not apply when:
- Talking with NPCs
- Resting at/near a bench
- Recoiling from other damage
- Unable to control the Knight otherwise
- In God Seeker mode

In addition to the above, the starve effect also doesn't apply when invulnerable.

You can adjust the difficulty under Settings -> Mods in-game.
